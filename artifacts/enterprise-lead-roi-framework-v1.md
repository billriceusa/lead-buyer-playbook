# Artifact - Enterprise Lead ROI Framework - v1

## Purpose
This framework provides a comprehensive model for calculating true ROI on enterprise lead buying programs, including often-overlooked costs and long-term value considerations.

## True Cost Per Opportunity Calculator

### Direct Lead Costs
```
Lead Purchase Cost = Total spend with vendor ÷ Number of leads
```

### Hidden Operational Costs (Often 25-40% of Direct Costs)

#### Vendor Management Costs
- **Account Management Time**: [X] hours/month × $[hourly rate] × 12 months
- **Contract Negotiation**: [X] hours annually × $[hourly rate]
- **Performance Reviews**: [X] hours quarterly × $[hourly rate] × 4
- **Issue Resolution**: [X] hours monthly × $[hourly rate] × 12

#### Technology and Integration Costs
- **Initial Setup**: $[X] per vendor (API integration, testing, validation)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: $[X] monthly per vendor (monitoring, updates, fixes)
- **Analytics Tools**: $[X] annually for performance monitoring platforms
- **CRM Integration**: $[X] annually for attribution and tracking systems

#### Compliance and Legal Costs
- **Legal Review**: $[X] per vendor contract and annual updates
- **Compliance Auditing**: $[X] quarterly for vendor compliance reviews
- **Documentation Management**: [X] hours monthly × $[hourly rate] × 12
- **Training and Certification**: $[X] annually for team compliance training

#### Quality Assurance Costs
- **Lead Validation**: $[X] monthly for verification services
- **Conversion Tracking**: [X] hours monthly × $[hourly rate] × 12
- **A/B Testing**: $[X] per test for statistical analysis tools
- **Reporting and Analytics**: [X] hours weekly × $[hourly rate] × 52

### Total Cost Per Lead Calculation
```
True Cost Per Lead = (Direct Costs + Operational Costs) ÷ Total Leads
```

### Conversion Funnel Analysis

#### Stage 1: Lead to Contact
- **Contact Rate**: [X]% of leads result in successful contact
- **Cost Per Contact**: True Cost Per Lead ÷ Contact Rate

#### Stage 2: Contact to Qualified Lead
- **Qualification Rate**: [X]% of contacts meet qualification criteria
- **Cost Per Qualified Lead**: Cost Per Contact ÷ Qualification Rate

#### Stage 3: Qualified Lead to Opportunity
- **Opportunity Rate**: [X]% of qualified leads become sales opportunities
- **Cost Per Opportunity**: Cost Per Qualified Lead ÷ Opportunity Rate

#### Stage 4: Opportunity to Close
- **Close Rate**: [X]% of opportunities result in sales
- **Cost Per Sale**: Cost Per Opportunity ÷ Close Rate

### ROI Calculation Framework

#### Revenue Attribution
```
Attributed Revenue = Number of Closed Deals × Average Deal Size
```

#### Profit Calculation
```
Gross Profit = Attributed Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Net Profit = Gross Profit - True Lead Program Costs
```

#### ROI Metrics
```
ROI = (Net Profit ÷ True Lead Program Costs) × 100
ROAS = Attributed Revenue ÷ True Lead Program Costs
Payback Period = True Lead Program Costs ÷ Monthly Net Profit
```

## Vendor Performance ROI Analysis

### Individual Vendor Assessment

#### Cost Efficiency Metrics
- **Cost Per Opportunity**: Total vendor cost ÷ opportunities generated
- **Cost Per Sale**: Total vendor cost ÷ sales closed
- **Cost Variance**: Month-over-month cost stability

#### Quality Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Leads to opportunities percentage
- **Close Rate**: Opportunities to sales percentage
- **Sales Cycle**: Average days from lead to close

#### Value Metrics
- **Average Deal Size**: Revenue per closed opportunity
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Long-term revenue attribution
- **Retention Rate**: Customer retention from this source

### Vendor Comparison Matrix

| Vendor | Cost/Opp | Conv Rate | Close Rate | Avg Deal | LTV | ROI |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|-----|-----|
| A      | $[X]     | [X]%      | [X]%       | $[X]     | $[X]| [X]%|
| B      | $[X]     | [X]%      | [X]%       | $[X]     | $[X]| [X]%|
| C      | $[X]     | [X]%      | [X]%       | $[X]     | $[X]| [X]%|

### Portfolio Optimization Model

#### Risk-Adjusted ROI
Factor in risk considerations:
- **Vendor Stability**: Historical performance consistency
- **Volume Reliability**: Ability to maintain lead flow
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory and legal risk factors
- **Competitive Risk**: Market position and differentiation

#### Optimal Allocation Model
```
Optimal Budget % = (Vendor ROI × Risk Factor) ÷ Sum of All (Vendor ROI × Risk Factor)
```

Maximum allocation constraints:
- No vendor >35% of total budget
- Minimum 3 vendors in active rotation
- Reserve 20% budget for testing and optimization

## Long-Term Value Analysis

### Customer Lifetime Value by Source

Track customers by lead source over time:
- **Month 1-6**: Initial purchase and onboarding success
- **Month 7-12**: First renewal and expansion opportunities
- **Month 13-24**: Long-term retention and advocacy
- **Month 25+**: Multi-year value and referral generation

#### Source Quality Indicators
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers retained after 12/24 months
- **Expansion Revenue**: Upsell and cross-sell success rates
- **Referral Generation**: New customer acquisition from referrals
- **Net Promoter Score**: Customer satisfaction by lead source
