# Book strategy and content planning for marketing sessions

Thu, 31 Jul 25

### Summit/Conference Planning

- Planning an event with a contact Bill has known for 20+ years
  - Former client from Griffin Funding when Bill ran a lead management software company
  - Opportunity to expand into other verticals
- Format will include multiple sessions/topics
  - Will leverage Bill’s industry connections in other verticals
  - Plan to create content structure for sessions in next couple weeks

### Book Creation Idea

- Create a 100-page self-published book to give attendees
  - Can self-publish through Amazon for $5-10 per book
  - Bill has prior self-publishing experience with an SEO book
  - Book would serve as a “thick business card” with better sticking power
- Content development approach:
  - Use session content framework as book structure
  - Create shared Google Sheet to capture topic ideas
  - Use AI to help with writing process
  - Include transcripts from industry interviews

### Book Content Plan

- Two-part content strategy:
  - Lead generation education for marketing directors
    - What lead generators do to deliver leads
    - What buyers should know about lead generation
  - Lead optimization for sales operations
    - How to have success with purchased leads
    - Importance of marketing/sales operations relationship
- Specific topics to include:
  - Time to contact data
  - SMS as key component with supporting data
  - My Perfect Mortgage form data on preferred contact methods

### Content Distribution Strategy

- Use planned book content for social media before event
  - Test which topics generate most interest
  - Use insights to refine book content
- Include book signing session at event

### Networking Update

- Bill meeting with former colleague for lunch
  - Person was recently laid off from Rocket after 20+ years
  - Has background as business analyst and designer
  - May be an interesting resource but likely not affordable

Transcript:
 
Me: For sure. I thought he was gonna ask for some money. So but yeah. No. He's he's a good dude. So we've  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: collaborated on a So but I've known him for wow, twenty plus years. So, actually, he was he was one when we were a software company, we did lead management. He was he was one of my clients. He worked for Griffin Funding at the time. So who's still around?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: But he was the marketing guy. So  
Them: Cool. Cool.  
Me: but yeah. So that's I think it could be really interesting too because because there are so many other verticals. I think as we prepare for this, I'll I'll poke around, get some of his relationships in the other verticals, and then you know, under that sort of purpose, we, you know, we can have some really interesting conversations with with folks in those industries and kinda see if there's opportunities for us you know, making another vertical or something.  
Them: Yeah. No. Absolutely. And I wonder  
Me: If  
Them: if there is you know, I know, like, a year ago, we talked about, like, a Ford, like, that, like, Forbes thing to, like, kinda write a book, but I wonder if we, like, jot out enough topics if we can, like, write up, like, a 100 page little thing and just have it, printed through Amazon, That's like, you know, to, like, hand out to the attendees or something. You know?  
Me: Yeah. For sure.  
Them: It's like because, like, you know, looking at it, we could self publish sign for, like, you know, $510 a per you know, a book. I think, like, 5 ish bucks.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, I don't know how many people would be there, but, you know,  
Me: Yeah. That's a that's a great idea. Yeah. And it's not it's not terribly hard. I did it actually, I did it years and years ago. I've got an SEO book out there. But, but, yeah, it's and I'm sure it's gotten a lot easier now. Just get there's a couple so I've got a I've got one that I been working on off and on, and yeah, you can find, like, people to do the cover now. The formatting is pretty easy. Edit. I know those guys that that I did that one book with, where I did a chapter in there. There now they've just created a series, and they're just pumping them out. They're all self published. They just got, like, a system going. So  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea. Just to give them a a little walk away. With with the content Yeah. I think that's that's a great idea, actually. So maybe what I'll do is I'll try to kinda work on the structure of the content first. For those sessions. And then maybe we use that as the framework to build out the book and just, like,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: you know, we could  
Them: No. Absolutely. That's what I was thinking. You know? Like and I wouldn't even  
Me: you know,  
Them: like, yeah, come up with, like, the ones we think are gonna be the best sessions but then just, like, throw out anything that we're you know, we've encountered or thought about. Right? You know?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Maybe we just either create, like, a Google Sheet that we share in and just shot ideas down. You know? Like, you know, like, the one we talked about a lot is, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: the time to contact. And, you know, the other data we collected was on the My Perfect Mortgage form on the preferred Right? Like, not that that's a whole chapter, but  
Me: It does  
Them: it does give the people insight as to why we think that, hey. You know what?  
Me: too. Wide. But it people  
Them: If you're not using SMS, it is such a key component now, and here's some, you know, data we've collected. So  
Me: I love that giving equal attention to both, like, okay. You know? Because I think from the buyer perspective, I mean, like a lot of marketing directors, when they get those positions, they often don't have the the practical you know, Goodness, how to sneeze. They don't have the you know, the practical knowledge of ever doing marketing. You know. And so I think you know, half maybe half of the book is about, like, okay, what do lead generators do you know, in order to deliver this product and what should you know about it as you're buying the product. And then the other half is, like, how do you have the most success with the product? So you kinda give them insight into the marketing, which is probably what they all think they wanna know and and know, think they need to know, and then give them this other side of, like, okay. Like, what do you do to to optimize your sales operations?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I love that. And how important it is because most of these lead buyers are are marketing You know? And so they just kinda toss them into sales and and and we've dealt with this too. Like, they're, like, we don't what happens to them afterwards. Right? Or they don't work closely with them or they just you know, pass through the feedback from the sales, which is  
Them: Yep.  
Me: the leads suck. You know? It's like So so that could be a way to kinda even talk about, like, how that relationship should be between marketing and sales operations. Yeah. I love that. It's a great idea.  
Them: Yeah. We'll set up a  
Me: Great idea. And it shouldn't it like that. It's like that. Like  
Them: book signing session for you too.  
Me: it's such There you go. Yeah.  
Them: Alright. Yeah.  
Me: Good idea. Yeah. I'll I'll I'll definitely work that up. Like I said, I think in the next couple weeks, try to get the content together. I mean, we can already start to use that as content because that's the other thing. Probably, if we can get that you know, with you and I collaborate on that, get to we think are some good sessions, then we'll just start, like, using that as content into social media, and then we'll get it'll be kinda like a you know, a little bit of a just testing, you know, to see what is really interesting. And then  
Them: Yep.  
Me: then from that, start to to buckle down on the book.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And, again, I don't know how feasible it is, but it sounds like it it to me, it would be something like a good handout for everyone. You know?  
Me: Oh, I think it's, yeah, it's a great way to stick with them. I mean, people always love to grab a book and you know, even if they don't know, open it up and read it, like, it's as long as it has  
Them: Yep.  
Me: you know, us and the company and the brand, you know, it's got all that on there. It's  
Them: It's gonna have more spicking power.  
Me: like, it's like a big thing. Business part. Yeah. It's a big, big, thick business card.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Think the other thing that could be interesting too is I do wanna have some sessions with some of those folks because I think by taking like, we can obviously have AI help us write a bunch of it. That'll kinda shorten. That's task. But I think if we can do the transcripts of all those interviews, that'll probably write the book by itself. It's just like all those insights.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: From talking to a bunch of people. So so  
Them: Alright.  
Me: yeah. Super.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I love it. Good idea.  
Them: Alright. Cool, man.  
Me: Alright. I gotta go off to lunch. Poor poor guy got cut at Rocket after I I worked with him  
Them: Alright. Talk to you later. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You mentioned that.  
Me: I was Yeah. So it's kinda so, anyway, he wanted to get together, but he's like, he's probably a little bit younger than me, but man, twenty plus years in one place and then  
Them: That sucks.  
Me: That does suck. Like, it's gonna have a hard road. Hopefully, he's well set up. They had a pretty good employee matching four zero one k and stuff. But, anyway, it's got some some kids that probably aren't in college yet and stuff like that. So anyway, so I'll be out for  
Them: Yep.  
Me: a a tad, but he's good dude. He was super good business analyst and designer.  
Them: Yeah. Alright.  
Me: So don't think we can afford him, but he might  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: interesting resource.  
Them: Alright. Sounds good, man. I'll talk with you later.  
Me: So alright. Alright. Talk soon.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Bye.
