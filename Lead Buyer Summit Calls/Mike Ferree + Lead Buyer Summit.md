Transcript:
 
Me: Hey, Michael.  
Them: Hey, Bill. How are you?  
Me: Hey, doing well. How are you doing?  
Them: I'm doing pretty good. Thank you. Yeah. Doing pretty good. You know? Just  
Me: I'm doing pretty good. You. Yeah. Doing pretty good. And I'm just getting ready  
Them: getting ready for this, contact that I o show we got coming up in  
Me: this contact that I have with you. Come up and Yeah.  
Them: about four weeks. And  
Me: Yeah. It's good.  
Them: that's going pretty well.  
Me: You got you got a busy portfolio anymore. Like, you're almost year round, it seems like.  
Them: Yeah. Well, we had, actually, it's  
Me: It's it's extremely slow.  
Them: it's sort of slowed down a little bit because we were trying to do  
Me: Little. Bit because trying to do  
Them: a UK show for, like, the last  
Me: any educational Right. I remember  
Them: three years. So then when we were doing that, it was, you know,  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Legion World, Legion World London and then contact at I o. But now we've just essentially got  
Me: Essentially  
Them: lead generation world here and then, contact dot I o working on it. So that's it it provides a nice balance. And and, unfortunately,  
Me: it it provides nice and, unfortunately,  
Them: despite my  
Me: just my thoughts  
Them: thoughts, yet the well, The UK just really couldn't work out. You know? They I was just a different market. You know?  
Me: That's what you had said when we talked before. By the way, Ken's my partner here, so I thought he'd bring him into discussion just because I didn't  
Them: How's it going?  
Me: what you had in mind. So  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, yeah, thanks for, Ken, it's a pleasure to  
Me: So so  
Them: to meet you. Yes. Thank you for getting on the call.  
Me: I  
Them: I wanted to you know, I don't know if you remember, Bill, but back in the day, one of the first things when I when Jay asked me to sorta  
Me: with Jeff.  
Them: take over the leads council or join the leads council, like, my third first thought was, like, I wanted to create a actually, it was a separate summit only for lead buyers. You know? And  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: really provide an a an opportunity for them to connect with each other, to share  
Me: For them. With each other. Other.  
Them: to, you know, communicate maybe they don't feel comfortable communicating in front of other brands, and then also not be  
Me: Communicating in front of other  
Them: Right? Because one of the big things is, like I mean, as a lead buyer, you're like, okay. I'm gonna go to this. I'm gonna hide in the corner usually, or I'm gonna just schedule meetings  
Me: something. To get  
Them: with the people I want and then try to turn my badge around so nobody knows who I am. You know, and then kinda hide.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And, you know, I went to Jay and said, hey. Can I you know, I think we need to start a a a buyer or something? He said, well, why don't we just do it with leads comp? You know? So so we'd  
Me: A start  
Them: started the lead the buy lead lead buyer summit at leads con, and we would do it a half day, before  
Me: so  
Them: everything else started. As you know, Jay sold leads con, and then maybe a year after that, I  
Me: please call me? It.  
Them: it just I left, and they just killed it, you know, because I wasn't running it.  
Me: Because Yeah.  
Them: But I really wanted to bring that back, you know, because I I do think there's value. There's there's multiple multiple value ads for having a lead buyer somewhere or something like this.  
Me: Something like this.  
Them: One is it obvious and the same reason why Jay wanted it was essentially, hopefully, it drives more lead buyers to the show. But  
Me: But  
Them: but on the flip side, it really does. I think  
Me: flip side I think  
Them: I think they I think a lot of them really enjoyed that sort of exclusive  
Me: they that. Exclusive.  
Them: safe  
Me: A  
Them: environment where they can hear things that are very specific to them and have open conversations about about, hey. Be careful about this, you know, or or we're doing this well over here, that sort of stuff. So I wanted to I wanna start we're we're going to start the lead buyer summit again. It's gonna be at Lead Generation World, San Diego. First one. And I felt was like, well, I could do this, but I maybe there's somebody that's you know? And I I can I certainly wanna help? But maybe there's somebody that is would would would be better than me at, you know, sort of talking to the buyers and seeing us. And, of course,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: you're the first guy I think of. I was like, yeah. You're doing a lot of content.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Around, you know, buying all that sort of stuff. I thought maybe there's a really good way to parlay Bill's expertise, his his interest in  
Me: K.  
Them: in, you know, thought leadership and all that sort of stuff and say, okay. Well, why don't Bill and I maybe work together on creating four four sessions? It's really quite simple, you know, for sessions or panels. He can host it. Essentially, MCD event. And, we make it a a buyer summit. You know? It's really that's it's actually pretty, easy. You know?  
Me: I was nervous you're gonna ask me, to to figure out venues and all that. It's like, that's so, yeah, just to to host it. But, yeah, I I love the  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I mean, that was that was really you know, some of the origin you know,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: leads 2006 when we did That was, you know,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: we were trying to really educate buyers because there was no information for It was like the secret society of lead generators and and buyers would buy from them, but they didn't didn't know what was going on, you know. And so  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: so I love it.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, my my I I think always since those those old days, gosh, almost twenty years ago, which is insane.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To say that. But you know, is that this industry is built on the backs of successful lead buyers.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: No way around it. If if a lead buyer is not successful, they're not buying leads. You know, and they're going out of business. So how do  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: you know, how does industry yeah. How does this industry continue to coddle those individuals to some extent educate them and ensure that they're being successful with buying or generating leads. You know? That's I mean, that that I've I've that's the listen. There's so much intertwined in lead generation and business to be had. Mean, there's businesses that, as you know, brokers that don't ever touch a lead buyer or don't even speak to a lead  
Me: To  
Them: but are making millions of dollars, annually just by brokering or being an affiliate or whatever you wanna call it. But so there's a lot of business on that, but that that doesn't go anywhere without a a good lead buyer. So, that's kinda where I'm at. Yeah.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. I think it's a so when is the San Diego show?  
Them: So this this one coming up is January.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And it's in San Diego. It's at a brand new Gaylord Hotel, which is just amazing, in San Die it's it's it's it's really great. People are just gonna love it. I think we're gonna be there for the next three or years. We're we're we're definitely there for two years, and then we're looking at extending it another two years just because it's I think it people are just gonna be over the moon about it. And so the idea would be to do the buyer summit on the fourth if my if my dates are correct, this Sunday.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Sunday from, like, let's just say, noon or one to four. Know, something like that.  
Me: So four sessions. I mean, my my first thought  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: were, like, you know, obviously, the compliance aspect, I think, is all you know, people are always interested in that. So and got some good relationships there. I feel like it would be interesting to bring Ethan into the mix to bring in some of his clients to talk about, like, the interior of lead management like, in some of the  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: of things that are happening in there. And then and then the other thing, I don't know how we would tackle this but it's something that we're running into. You know, Ken and I are are running into. We're in a weird market, and and we need to do this beyond, and I'd have to bring some expertise from insurance and and maybe some of the other verticals. But what we're seeing right now is it's easy enough to fill like, lead buyer demand. But but particularly in mortgage where we operate most, the market has softened so much that those leads like, they're there. But the intent and the the ability to to do the transaction that they wanna do is so soft. It's like this other this additional layer to quality, that's really impacting us. And then, of course, the other  
Them: When you say Bill, when you say soft, do you mean, like, the intent to pursue  
Me: Yeah. So for instance, I mean, you were in the mortgage industry. So, like,  
Them: moving forward as low? Is that what you mean? Or yeah.  
Me: very specific, like, hypothetical scenario based kind of things. So first time home buyers. Coming in, wanna buy, know they wanna buy at some point, can't find houses. So sales cycle's now a hundred and twenty, a hundred and sixty days. Even DSCR and real estate investors, some weird stuff in there that I don't know how interesting it would be to the audience that we're finding out is that used to be the purview of private equity and hard money. Where we dealt with that, a lot of real estate investors. Retail mortgage is so starved for origination that they've aggressively come in to this this space with DSCR, which is an asset based lending product. It's not a it's not a consumer credit based product.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: So that's causing tension with private and hard money. And so those guys are moving to different segments sort of recreating subprime. And then you got JPMorgan saying, hey, I want a piece of private credit. And so anyway, there's some some really interesting dynamics there. But even there, real estate investors can't find the properties, the property values are going up, they can't make the margin they need on short term and long term rentals. I mean, I'm actively just just  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I was looking in the Florida market, and one of the things that's happening there is they just can't get those short term rentals. So all of these short term rental real estate investors are backing out the market, and they're sort of fire sailing a lot of that property down there. So there's some interesting dynamics inside of the actual market that's making the lead like, they'll talk to you. They're curious. They're gonna fill out forms. But like, it's just not converting. Or it's converting so long.  
Them: Interesting. Months down the road. Yeah. And then you run into the load officers, like, I need to sell this month. I don't really care if you're coming back in five, six months because and then they kinda fall off the you know, off the rate.  
Me: Yeah. And and the more sophisticated people that are winning are that they're doing where the the lead management part comes back into play. The more sophisticated lenders like Rocket, you know, realize it's all about the data, and they just go out and buy a database.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Mean, that's basically what they did with mister Cooper. They just went and bought  
Them: Yep.  
Me: the biggest database  
Them: Zillow. Then they just buy Zillow as well or Redfin. What was it? Which one?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Redfin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So, I mean, they're just yeah. So anyway, I don't we always have to be well, you know this better than I do probably, but like, we have to be careful not to go too far in the weeds. But at the same time, like, maybe enlighten some of the things that are happening in the lead itself, you know, to kinda  
Them: I think what's, yeah. I I yeah. One one thing to consider, we can get into the, you know, topical and we have a lot of time, essentially. I I I won't even start working on the main agenda until September, so another month or so from now. But I but on that note, it would be great to outline some different things early as possible because then we start I can promote it a little bit more. Without getting too off track, I was going to say, you know, everyone that goes into this is gonna be approved lead buyer as well. So they go through my application process and they get so we're gonna have really good sense of who's gonna be there and all that sort of stuff. But going back to your point, yeah, there's gonna be insurance buyers there too. Right? There's gonna be solar. There's gonna be debt. Know? There's not just more you know? So when it comes to content, depending on how many how we break it up, because it could be thirty minute like, workshop sessions that we you can bang out a bunch of those.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Four, five minute hour workshop discussion or panel discussions. You q and a, ask me anything kinda stuff. Like, you know, we can really get a good and I what I thought was most successful when I was doing it was I was pretty active with, the microphone during things, asking questions, you know, being that guy, not just going up and going, okay. Here's next, but having a microphone and really pulling questions out of people. Well, hey. Let anybody have any so far? Like, stopping and have actually actually having my own questions. So it it it builds this, very organic conversational type of, opportunity versus just, hey. I'm gonna sit down and listen to these you know, three guys talk about whatever it is. But like I said, not to get off too off track, but I think I think Heath, anybody that you think would be good that we can we can sort of talk through this if this is you wanna do, and we can kinda brainstorm a little bit and go, what are the you know, top things that people are really struggling with today from a lead buyer perspective? You know, the the ones that obviously hit the you know, we'll will always be the same issues as, you know, you know, vetting lead sources, determining good sources. And then, of course, lead nurturing is essentially is what you're talking about right now with mortgage and and now how that's sort of extended beyond just what we used to think of, like, a thirty or forty five day at the max lean nurturing. Now we're talking maybe to your point sixty days and and further.  
Me: Yeah. Oh, we Yeah.  
Them: You know? So that that's really, really interesting conversation. I think that might be happening other verticals too. So that that that that turns into a whole conversation. And then, of course, compliance  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: and then, you know, the old buzzword AI. You know, you know,  
Me: I think that's becoming a a play. The other the other part where  
Them: we try to  
Me: the AI could be I mean, again, I think we should cover it. That'll that'll bring some interest for sure. But what about talking about and this is probably lightened up a little bit with the TCPA stuff going away, but what about talking a little bit about first party lead generation and, like, how does that fit into the the mix? So  
Them: A 100%. So  
Me: okay.  
Them: I mean, that we either target that or we go you know, we you could even talk about marketing mix in general or lead mix or however however people are labeling portfolio mix. I don't know what what what it is. Yeah. What percentages, third third party, what percentage is inbound calls or transfers? What percentage is lead gen you know, first party you know, you know, what are the challenges with first party lead gen. You know? I I mean, there's you know, Bill, there's you think you put a you put a which is a pretty amazing. You I think you do a post almost every day or every other  
Me: Yeah. Pretty pretty close.  
Them: day. That's it. I I mean, there is so much to talk about. Well, though you probably are getting to the point where  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: what do I talk about next? But, there are so many ideas Exactly.  
Me: Augments  
Them: Yeah. Well, point is is that we won't have enough time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know what I mean? It's really easy to fill up four or five sessions or panel discussions. It's it's extremely easy. But I just you know, I think my goal is, again, to get back to building this industry and really supporting lead buyers and creating giving them a really powerful opportunity, not just added sessions, but to come in and talk with other buyers and leaders that are lead buyers. And and I think, I just thought it'd be awesome if you wanted to sort of help host  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: it and  
Me: Yeah. I mean,  
Them: that, and I'll be there too. But,  
Me: it's like, it feels like a no brainer sure. Love to be in there.  
Them: Yeah. And, obviously, we'll take care of your registrations, and we'll even we you know, you know, we can even you know, in the commentary, the descriptions, we we'll we'll certainly have, you know, Bill Rice, know, hosting it in a cat you know, a Kaleidico or whatever whatever you wanna do to  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: business, you know, you wanna we can do that too. So  
Me: Okay. Yeah. That's that's beautiful. I I mean, I think it's a no brainer. Like, we'd love to be in that position. I'd I'd love the the the content and the topic. Around that as we kinda, you know, go towards September, are you thinking there would be other folks in the room other than buyers? So, like, for instance, I'm thinking like, do we have somebody like Ethan inside a session? Do we have somebody like the guy  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: from Lead Rilla? Inside an insurance session? I'm thinking about guys like Andrew. Like, you thinking there would be other folks that we should bring into the sessions or wanna keep it  
Them: Yes. A 100%. So speaker wise, we can bring anybody into the room. And the essentially, speakers can sit in the room too. You know? That's kinda how I've worked it out in the past is, like, yeah. You you know, you're gonna be here You can come and sit down in the room. But, so, yeah, we're not we're not, our our hands aren't tied to just lead buyers for speakers or panelists or whatever it may be. We wanna we wanna bring in the experts, essentially.  
Me: Right. Okay. Well, I was I was asking on that front too because I think, you know,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: some of those relationships, I'd love to probably set up some time with with some of those folks and just poke you know, you know, around in their brain for what are the hot tub like, think in particular, missing his name right now. I haven't talked to him in a while, but the guy from Lead Rilla, he's super deep and  
Them: Colby?  
Me: Kobe. Yeah.  
Them: Oh, Kobe Hasty?  
Me: Talking guy. But  
Them: Yeah. It's uh-huh. Recession. Right?  
Me: but, yeah, nice nice guy. But he's deep in insurance and health care and  
Them: Nice kid, though.  
Me: like that. So I think he's probably got some interesting insights there. Andrew's always you know, I think he could be really interesting on the first party. He's really banging that drum.  
Them: Andrew who?  
Me: So it's Andrew Pollack from lead pops.  
Them: Oh, yeah. Gosh. He's awesome, isn't he? Yeah. I love what he's doing.  
Me: So so I think that  
Them: And he's well for San Diego too.  
Me: yeah. He's in yeah. So I'm sure he'd be all in. And then like I said, Ethan's like, that internal lead management, you know, always had a passion for it, and nobody ever, like, focuses enough. Like, we talked about before, you know, you could easily three extra sales just by working on the sales part, but nobody does. They just keep buying more leads, you know. It's like  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: which is a a horrible thing for  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: lead sellers, but at the end of the day, like, there's so much juice to be squeezed out of the sales process.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So but  
Them: I mean, I think it'd be great. I think next steps, essentially, is just letting this sort of sit a little bit and thinking about it, maybe jotting down notes when you come across things and go like, and we come up we come back together maybe September 1. I'm just throwing that date out there. But I don't know what day that is. But, you know, September, and just circle back and then we sort of compile our notes and go, okay. What do we where do what direction do we wanna go with?  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And then, essentially, you know, you can go out. I can also help, you know, find people if we want to. If you don't have your account, we can just we'll work together on this. And then  
Me: Totally. Okay. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. Snow no no brainer. We'll probably I'll throw some stuff together sooner than that just so we can kinda  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: we need to know? Because I I think there's some some gaps in my relationships that, you know, you'll be able to fill in. But I I I would really like to kinda talk into each of those industries just to really understand like, feet on the ground. You know? Because we see part of it, but solar is a whole different animal. EDU, we haven't played in. Insurance, we a little bit. But, yeah, I'd like to poke around some of those other industries and start to flush out that knowledge.  
Them: Yeah. Like the AI stuff, haven't done a ton of  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: stuff in there. So, like, if you have any sponsors or whatever, like, you know, that might be helpful too. Yeah. No. For sure.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, we we we can we can once we kinda figure out, like, where these top you know, topics should go, then we can kinda start reaching out to those individuals and, know, picking their brain and seeing what what, you know, what where where the best to focus would be. But, yeah. Yeah. So if if it was two to four. Right? So, what is that? Three hours?  
Me: Yeah. So  
Them: So six at a at a max at six thirty minute sessions, narrow it down five narrow it down to five with a  
Me: six seven. Okay.  
Them: couple break a break and be maybe, I don't to be honest with you, for this many this, I don't like taking breaks. Just keep people in the room.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: They leave the room, they don't come back, or they come back fifteen minutes later and all those kind of stuff.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: We'll just sort of bang them out. But Max has you know, five five to six thirty minute sessions. Now if we do 45, now that shrinks it down a little bit to dip and  
Me: Six.  
Them: you know, maybe there's yeah. And maybe we can extend the  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: time. Let's let's just see where this goes, and then we can we're pretty flexible. We've got a room of you know, we could fit a 150 or so people in there, which I think will be perfect. It'll be nice, and I think it should be tight. Not not nothing like not in a big room where it feels like there's only two people in You know?  
Me: For sure. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I  
Them: But that's  
Me: yeah, we can flush out a framework.  
Them: okay.  
Me: Pretty quickly and that that'll let us figure out how much more work we need to do. Okay.  
Them: Okay. Alright. Well, you're pod committed now, buddy. You're you're in.  
Me: Okay. Okay. I love it. I I, you know, I love the conferences. I I don't have the skills you guys do to put the full events on, but I've always know, been passionate about bringing these communities together because it's just so much much to be learned and  
Them: Yeah. I I really love this buyer summit.  
Me: so Yeah.  
Them: I'm gonna promote the heck out of it. You know, we we just sort of announced it the other week just on LinkedIn. Nothing nothing major. But we'll we're gonna really promote it and,  
Me: Yeah. We'll try to do the same. I mean, we got some  
Them: you know, hopefully, get a lot of people in there.  
Me: we've got some decent buyers now in our portfolio, so I think we'll yeah, we'll try to promote the heck out of that.  
Them: Yeah. Because, I mean, the the kicker for what we do, you know, with both lead contact and lead gen world is that we have a lead buyer pass. It's only, you know, Although we just raised it to $395 from $2.95,  
Me: It's crazy.  
Them: mean, that's so cheap. For a lead buyer to attend a show. And the reason why I did it was because you know some of the may even the largest brands have a hard time getting a conference approved.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, at the expense even though they, you know, they can go and they can tell their you know, hunt you know, half a billion dollar company that, hey. This is gonna benefit us. Just give me you know, $3,000 or whatever to go to wherever.  
Me: It's  
Them: It's tough for them. So we try to lower that price, get them there. It's valuable to us that they're there anyways.  
Me: Yeah. So  
Them: So, anyway, the point is all these lead buyers have an opportunity to get here pretty inexpensively. And get a lot of value out of it. So  
Me: Yeah. For sure. Yeah. I mean, the comparables. Right? I mean, Housing Wire and Linning Tree Summit. I mean, those are thousands of dollars. The pass. You know? It's like  
Them: Yeah. I mean and, you know, good on those those conferences for being able to do that and get them you know? But you know, we  
Me: yeah. I think you get a different I I don't think you get the the the true execution. You get, like, the highest level executives that probably even aren't even making decisions anymore. They're just they're just there to you know, hear the latest and greatest and then just shove it down  
Them: Yeah. Purchase it on the funnel. Yeah.  
Me: you know, Correct. So  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: it's good to have, like, some practitioners in the room that are media buyers and responsible for
