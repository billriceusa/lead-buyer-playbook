# Back Cover

## Hook / Benefit Statement (Top - Bold, Large Text)

**Stop buying leads. Start building a revenue engine.**

---

## Opening Statement (Centered, Medium Text)

Most lead buyers are playing a game they can't win—buying volume, squeezing vendors, and hoping sales figures it out. Meanwhile, costs climb, contact rates fall, and compliance risk grows.

## Book Pitch (Body Copy)

This book will change the way you think about lead generation.

For twenty years, Bill Rice has been on both sides of the lead generation equation—building consumer direct systems for major lenders and running a lead generation agency. *The Lead Buyer's Playbook* is the operational blueprint he wishes someone had handed him when he started. Inside:

- Why "more volume, lower price" is mathematically broken
- How to hit 20%+ contact rates when industry average is 8%
- The 90-day action plan to transform your lead operation

Every framework has been tested with mortgage, insurance, legal, and home services companies—from startups to enterprises managing seven-figure monthly budgets. Master strategic lead generation and grow more predictably, profitably, and sustainably than competitors stuck in tactical mode.

## Tagline (Centered, Bold)

**Your competitors are fighting over satisfactory leads.**

**Build something that lasts.**
