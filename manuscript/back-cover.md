### Hook Statement

**Stop buying satisfactory leads. Start building a revenue engine.**

---

### Opening Paragraph

Most lead buyers are playing a game they can't win. They chase volume, squeeze vendors on price, and hope the sales team figures it out. Meanwhile, cost per lead keeps climbing, contact rates keep falling, and compliance risk keeps growing.

### Body Copy

For twenty years, Bill Rice has been on both sides of the lead generation equation—building consumer-direct systems for major lenders and running a lead generation agency. He's watched smart professionals burn through marketing budgets on bad data while competitors build systematic advantages that compound over time.

*The Lead Buyer's Playbook* is the operational blueprint he wishes someone had handed him when he started. Inside, you'll discover:

- Why the "more volume, lower price" strategy is mathematically broken
- How to hit 20%+ contact rates when the industry average hovers at 8%
- The vendor management framework that turns adversaries into partners
- Compliance systems that protect you from TCPA lawsuits and regulatory risk
- A 90-day action plan to transform your lead operation from cost center to competitive advantage

This isn't theory. Every framework has been tested in the field with mortgage, insurance, legal, and home services companies—from startups buying their first leads to enterprises managing seven-figure monthly budgets.
