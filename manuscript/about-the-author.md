# About the Author

Bill Rice is a lead generation strategist who coined the term "lead management" and developed the mortgage industry’s first intelligent lead scoring system. His perspective is shaped by a career spent designing consumer direct systems for major lenders and running his own lead generation agency.

Bill was a founding member of **DeepGreen Bank**, one of the first internet-only banks, and an early innovator in consumer direct acquisition at **Quicken Loans** (now Rocket Mortgage). In these roles, he helped architect the digital origination models that defined the modern industry, learning firsthand the operational challenges of scaling lead volume.

Today, Bill serves as a trusted insider who understands exactly how leads are generated, packaged, and sold. As the owner of **Kaleidico**, a digital marketing agency, he maintains a transparent view into the vendor side of the equation, generating first-party leads for mortgage, legal, and senior living companies.

Bill applies the pattern recognition skills from his time as a U.S. Air Force intelligence officer to bring clarity to the complex lead marketplace. He lives in Monroe, Michigan, and publishes weekly analysis on growth strategy at **MyExecutiveBrief.com**.
